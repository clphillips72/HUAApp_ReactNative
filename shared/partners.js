      We have an application process. The application asks information that helps us determine whether the home would be the right one for that animal.`

      description: `Hearts United for Animals is one of the nation's leaders in the fight against puppy mills. Since 1996 we have rescued over 10,000 dogs from puppy mills. The atrocities we see are staggering. The injuries we repair, both emotional and physical are beyond comprehension for most loving pet owners. With your help we fight for a day when dogs are no longer housed by the hundreds, stacked in wire cages, suffering from lack of medical care with no family to call their own, no beds, no blankets, no clean food or water and no concept of what it means to be loved and cared for.
      With your help we are gaining ground and winning the fight. Due to a combination of public education, legislation and enforcement there are 1,532 less USDA licensed breeders in the U.S. in 2013 than there were in the year 2010. There are still thousands of unscrupulous mills left to go and we will continue the fight until they are gone.`

      description: `By the end of 2020, the HUA Clinic surpassed the number of 20,000 dog and cat patients, preventing over 2 million births. Beginning at the opening day in October of 2003, the clinic gained huge popularity across the four corners of Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and Kansas, and far into central Nebraska. A long waiting list of clients grew.
      The 40-dollar fee requested by the clinic (and waived if it is a burden) includes tests, vaccinations, and anything else our animal welfare veterinarian and staff can do for the health and comfort of the animals.      
      The clinic, with its state of the art equipment, operates under the high professional standards of our veterinarian, Dr. James Gigstad of Nebraska City. All patients receive pain and antibiotic injections, and oxygen and intravenous support are available at all times. Recovery time is carefully monitored by the clinic staff.`

      description: `Hearts United for Animals is dedicated to the philosophy that all dogs deserve happy healthy lives with people who love them. Some dogs find that home with us as Sanctuary Sweethearts. They are animals who are not up for adoption for various reasons including health, age and personality issues.
      The Sanctuary Sweethearts live full, comfortable, happy lives at Hearts United. It costs about 25 dollars a month to care for these special needs dogs (and to keep them in frisbees and balls!) The Sweetheart Program allows people to sponsor one of the animals living at the Shelter. We will send you a photo and information about the dog you are sponsoring and will update you on their lives during the year. You can stop your donation at any time.
      These are some of the dogs who live at the Shelter as Sanctuary Sweethearts. You can sponsor a Sanctuary Sweetheart by clicking on the link below. The cost is twenty-five dollars a month.`
